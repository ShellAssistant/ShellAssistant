What is Shell Assistant?
========================
- A modern redesign of the traditional terminal, SSH client, remote file manager and viewer, code editor and SFTP client.
- Great for connecting to Unix hosts on the cloud or on your local network.
- Connect to remote hosts over SSH, including Amazon Web Service EC2, Linodes, Digital Ocean, Raspberry Pi's, you name it.
- Connect to local unix-like installations running Mac OS, Linux, MinGW, Cygwin, Git-bash and Windows Subsystem for Linux.
- A great tool for your toolbox if you're into Unix, Linux, Mac Command Line, Raspberry Pi's or anything that uses a Command Line Interface.
